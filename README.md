# Data Engineering Projects

This GitHub repository showcases my classwork projects undertaken as part of the [Udacity Data Engineering Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) program. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in various data engineering concepts and tools.

## 1. Relational Database: Data Modeling with PostgreSQL

This project involved creating a relational database using PostgreSQL, encompassing data modeling with a star-schema and loading data onto the database using an ETL pipeline. The project highlighted the fundamentals of relational database design and implementation.

## 2. NoSQL Database: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

Expanding into the realm of NoSQL databases, this project focused on creating a NoSQL database using Apache Cassandra. The task involved designing denormalized tables tailored to specific needs and queries, demonstrating the flexibility and scalability of NoSQL databases.

## 3. Data Warehouse: Amazon Redshift

Venturing into the cloud, this project involved building a cloud data warehouse on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Redshift. The project encompassed creating a Redshift cluster, configuring it, and developing a pipeline to load and transform data onto the cluster. This project emphasized the power of cloud-based data warehousing.

## 4. Data Lake: Spark

This project delved into the creation of a data lake on AWS S3, utilizing Spark to execute an ETL pipeline. The pipeline involved loading source data, processing it, and writing it back to S3 in efficient partitioning and Parquet formatting, enabling end-users to readily utilize the data. This project highlighted the capabilities of Spark in data lake management.

## 5. Data Pipelines: Airflow

This project focused on automating an ETL pipeline using Airflow, a workflow management tool. The pipeline replicated data from S3 to Redshift on a scheduled basis. The project covered creating tables, loading data from sources, filling data into tables, and performing data validation, demonstrating the effectiveness of Airflow in automating data pipelines.

## 6. Final Capstone Project

This project culminated the acquired skills from previous projects by building a comprehensive data lake that integrated data from multiple sources. The project involved designing, developing, and deploying the data lake, showcasing the ability to handle complex data engineering challenges.

These projects collectively demonstrate my comprehensive understanding of data engineering principles and tools, along with the ability to apply these concepts to real-world data challenges.

# Data Engineering Projects

This GitHub repository contains my classwork projects as a part of
the [Udacity data engineering nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) program.

### 1. Relational database: Data Modeling with PostgreSQL

Create a relational database using PostgreSQL which begins from data modeling with star-schema to loading data onto the
database with ETL pipeline.

### 2. NoSQL database: Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

Create a NoSQL database using Apache Cassandra with denormalized tables that are designed for specific needs and queries.

### 3. Data warehouse: Amazon Redshift

Build a cloud data warehouse on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Redshift service which begins by creating a Redshift
cluster, configure the cluster, and develop a pipeline to load data onto the cluster and transform them.

### 4. Data lake: Spark

Create a data lake on AWS S3 by using Spark to perform an ETL pipeline from loading sources data, processing, and writing
them back to S3 in efficient partitioning and parquet formatting that enables end-users to easily make use of them.

### 5. Data pipelines: Airflow

Use Airflow to automate an ETL pipeline that copies data from S3 to Redshift on a regular basis. The pipeline steps include
tables creation, load data from sources, fill data into the tables and perform data validation.

### 6. Final capstone project

Use all skills learned from previous projects to build a data lake that combines data from multiple sources.
